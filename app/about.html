        <h2>About LiVE MAG!</h2>
        

        <p><strong>LiVE MAG!</strong> was born to run at the Bowery Poetry Club. Bob Holman and Jeff Wright conceived it as a performance / publication event created specifically for the Club.</p> 

        <p>The earlier events from 2007 to 2010 featured editors of other publications as guests &mdash; eg, Hannah Winarsky, editor of Princeton University Press, William Electric Black of La Mama ETC., Michael Andre of <i>Unmuzzled Ox</i>, Bob Hershon of <i>Hanging Loose</i> and the late Akilah Oliver, the Monday night coordinator of the Poetry Project at St. Mark’s Church &mdash; who read their own works, some favorites, and then solicited poems from the audience to read. </p>

        <p><strong>LiVE MAG!</strong> has evolved as an equal mix of art and poetry. In a unique partnership with La Mama, ETC, the magazine hosts an annual print publication party.</p>

        <p><strong>Publisher and Editor, Jeffrey Cyphers Wright</strong>, moved to New York City in 1976 and began Hard Press, publishing poetry postcards and books. He attended workshops at St. Mark's Poetry Project with Ted Berrigan, Alice Notley and Jim Brodey. He went on to study with Allen Ginsberg at Brooklyn College where he earned a Masters of Fine Arts in Poetry. Wright launched <i>Cover Magazine</i> in 1987. Its contributors included Molly Jong-Fast, Timothy Greenfield-Sanders, John Yau, Robert C. Morgan, David Ulin, Jeanne C. Wilkinson, and KK Kozik. The 64 page monthly journal circulated nationally until 2000. </p>

        <p>Wright has reviewed poetry for the <i>Poetry Project Newsletter</i> and <i>The Brooklyn Rail</i> and wrote art criticism for <i>Artnexus, Art &amp; Antiques, Chelsea Now</i>, the <i>Villager, On-Verge</i> and other publications. He has written 13 books of poetry (Ginsberg wrote a forward to his <i>Take Over</i>,) and appeared in numerous anthologies. He regularly exhibits and publishes his own artwork as well.</p>
